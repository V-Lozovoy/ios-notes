# ios-notes
This was my bachelor's thesis project in Computer Science. 
So, I developed an iOS notes application called "Simple Notes" in Swift that allows users to perform basic note-taking functions, including creating, editing, deleting, and restoring notes, as well as text formatting (bold, italic, underline).
