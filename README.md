# ios-notes
This was my bachelor's thesis project in Computer Science. 
I developed an iOS notes application called "Simple Notes" in Swift that allows users to perform basic note-taking functions, including:
  1) creating
  2) editing, as well as text formatting (bold, italic, underline)
  3) deleting
  4) and restoring notes

Also, I have uploaded a video demonstration (Application demo.mp4) of how the application works to this repository.
